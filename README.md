# Camping-Fivem
With this script you can setup configurable temporary Camps and a Grill. You can define zones and the Camps where you are not able to place them
With the Grill you are able to grill everything you configure under "ConfigCamping.grillfleisch"

Since a former development friend named Stoned0001 also on this plattform started leaking my scripts, I decided to upload them by myself
