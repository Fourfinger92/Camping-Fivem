# Camping-Fivem
With this script you can setup configurable temporary spawnable Camps, all Props and a Grill. You can define zones and the Camps where you are not able to place them
With the Grill you are able to grill everything you configure under "ConfigCamping.grillfleisch", you can only have 1 grill at the same time and you can get the grill back to you inventory

Since a former development friend named Stoned0001 also on this plattform started leaking my scripts, I decided to upload them by myself
